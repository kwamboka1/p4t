                        <strong>Planning For Tomorrow Youth Organisation (P4T)</strong>  is a volunteer-based, 
                        non-profit organization which was started by <strong>refugees</strong> in November 2007 
                        in Kyangwali refugee settlement, Kikuube district, Uganda. It was legally registered in 
                        2013 with <strong>Registration number CD/WG/0199/13</strong> and Incorporated with
                        <strong>URSB Registration No: 80020002652537.</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 2021, P4T was fully registered in <strong>Norway</strong> with <strong>Registration 
                        number 926 924 826</strong> with the main purpose of fundraising resources to support 
                        P4T's projects in Uganda and also to promote multicultural diversity in Norway by promoting 
                        integration and intercultural dialogue and work with a diverse and inclusive society.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        P4T works in four thematic areas of <strong>Education, Health, Livelihoods</strong> and 
                        <strong>Protection & Community Services.</strong>

                    <p>
                        According to UNHCR, there are over 1.5 million refugees in Uganda and 80% are children and 
                        women. Uganda is the third largest refugee host country in the world and the largest refugee 
                        host country in Africa.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We seek to alleviate the suffering of millions of refugees and host communities and promote 
                        coexistence for a self-reliant and sustainable humanity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We believe that by using the people who are part of the community suffering the problems, 
                        the best solutions can be achieved. We therefore use the Human Centre Design (HCD) approach, 
                        a Bottom-Up Strategy in designing our projects because there is nothing for us without us.
