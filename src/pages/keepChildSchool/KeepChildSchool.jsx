                    More than 5 million Ugandan school-age children have left primary school before 
                    7th grade. Only 5% of children with disabilities have access to education. 
                    For millions of children in Uganda, a quality education is unattainable due to 
                    tuition fees or the lack of a school nearby. This easily leads to a vicious 
                    circle of poverty and deprives them of the opportunity to have good lives. 
                    YOU can change this. By supporting a child or becoming a sponsor, you can ensure 
                    that a child gets the pleasure of a good education and the chance to reach his or 
                    her full potential.

                    school because I want to be poor. This is not what I wanted ‚Äù(Girl, 13 years old

                    Refugee children are 5 times more likely to drop out of school than other 
                    children. Supporting a child means giving them new hope for a better future.
