                    P4T Empower women with Fistula in their economic and social re-introductions in

                    Uganda has the second highest birth rate in the world and maternal mortality is 
                    very high. Limited access to quality maternal care continues to pose a major risk 
                    for pregnancy-related disorders. Obstetric fistulas, a vaginal injury that usually 
                    occurs during prolonged births with a lack of proper medical care, are very common 
                    and many women are unaware that this can be treated and often corrected through 
                    surgery.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Obstetric fistulas are a medical condition in which a hole develops in the birth 
                    canal as a result of a birth. This occurs especially between the vagina and 
                    bladder or rectum, and results in incontinence of urine and feces. Obstetric 
                    fistulas are by far the most common form of fistula in the Kyangwali Refugee 
                    Settlement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to the physical ailments this causes for women, psychological stigma 
                    and the accompanying bad smell that comes from the disorder lead to major social 
                    and economic consequences. Not least, many of the women experience major emotional 
                    and psychological problems, including feelings of shame, depression, lack of 
                    self-confidence, rejection and loss of marital and sexual rights.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Women with Obstetric Fistulas are often neglected by their husbands and families, 
                    cannot work and are stigmatized by the local community. They are very often among 
                    the poorest and most vulnerable. P4T offers psychosocial support before and after 
                    surgery with support from Medical Teams International (MTI), which operates 
                    surgical units to repair Obstetric Fistulas for Women in the Kyangwali Refugee 
                    Settlement and the local community.

                        In Uganda, almost 1.6 million people live with HIV, of which almost 96,000 are 
                        children under the age of 14. Orphans due to AIDS are estimated to be 660,000 
                        children, and annually approx. 28,000 people with AIDS die according to a 
                        study by UNAIDS.

                        Kyangwali Refugee Settlement is a multicultural place that needs a 
                        multicultural approach to address common issues such as HIV / AIDS and 
                        gender-based sexual violence (SGBV). P4T is run by people from many different 
                        cultures and countries; DR-Congo, South Sudan, Rwanda, Kenya, Burundi and 
                        Uganda.

                        Due to the difficulties of the refugees, many of them are vulnerable to 
                        HIV / AIDS due to family breakdown, repeated relocations, greater 
                        socio-economic vulnerability and sexual violence such as rape, oppression, 
                        sexual exploitation of women and children in particular. Most refugees are 
                        afraid to admit that they are infected, while others suffer from depression 
                        due to discrimination and stigma, cultural counter-perceptions, premature and 
                        forced marriages, substance abuse and alcoholism.

                        Prostitution has contributed to large networks that increase the chance of 
                        getting HIV and other infections. Women and children are the most vulnerable 
                        in this situation. Surveys conducted by ACCORD in December 2013 showed that 
                        over 60% of women in the Kyangwali Refugee Settlement do not go to maternity 
                        care. This makes them particularly vulnerable to mother-to-child transmission 
                        of HIV and maternal mortality. As previously mentioned, most refugees are 
                        afraid to admit that they carry the infection.

                        <strong>The 90 90 90 strategy</strong> has an ambitious goal of stopping the 
                        AIDS pandemic. P4T focuses on the first 90 by assuring us that 90% of the 
                        population has been tested and knows about their own status. We regularly 
                        perform Voluntary Counseling and HIV Testing (VCT) as well as HIV awareness 
                        training and campaigns in the Kyangwali Refugee Settlement and the surrounding 
                        community.

                        Living Positively (LP) HIV project focuses on people who are infected and 
                        affected by HIV / AIDS (ie PHAs and OVCs) and ensures that people in the local 
                        community who are HIV-negative learn to protect themselves in a mixed society. 
                        P4T also works to enable PHAs to live good lives in harmony with other people 
                        without discrimination and stigmatization as well as empowering orphans to 
                        become resourceful both socially and financially.

                        P4T started medical mission program in 2019 in Uganda where we mobilize 
                        international doctors from several countries to come and help save lives and 
                        provide hope for refugees and underdeveloped communities. The mission brought 
                        in 20 International Medical Volunteers from different countries like France, 
                        Canada, UK and USA, provided direct health services to 6000+ patients and 
                        trained 240+ health workers in UNHCR and Government of Uganda health centers 
                        (Maratatu and Kyangwali Health Center III) in Kyangwali Refugee settlement. 
                        This is on top of medical supplies worth USD 40,000 and medical equipment 
                        worth USD 25,000 including 5 ultrasound machines and hospital beds.

                        Lack of information about health crises is a crisis in itself. Ailing from 
                        violating war situations and living in states of emergencies; HIV/AIDS, GBV, 
                        Cholera, Ebola and now COVID 19 have remained misunderstood and mishandled in 
                        the multi-cultural refugee population. P4T provide health education both 
                        refugees and host communities mostly in area of Cholera, Ebola, HIV/AID,
