                <p>
                    Education is a basic human right that should be afforded to all .Education may not 
                    be denied to any child, including in the circumstances that make him or her a 
                    refugee. Uganda is home to 1.5 million refugees, which 60% are children, forced to 
                    flee from conflict and war in the Democratic Republic of Congo, South Sudan, 
                    Burundi, Somalia, and Rwanda leaving behind their homes, livelihoods, and education.
                    Schools are often dangerously overcrowded by over 200 children per class attended 
                    to by one teacher and lack basic resources, lack feeding, children walk long 
                    distances to school, lack of psychosocial support and living in extremely poverty 
                    only dependency on World Food Programme with only $6 USD per head in the family 
                    monthly for food and As a result, the quality of learning is often poor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Education is the foundation of a child’s future, yet millions of children in Uganda 
                    – especially in the poorest areas – are being left behind. We aim to ensure 
                    children have a quality learning environment by providing refresh training for 
                    teachers and education officials; pay school staff’s salaries, working with 
                    communities to increase parental engagement; building infrastructure such as 
                    classrooms, libraries and latrines; and providing school furniture such as desks, 
                    chairs, provide scholastic and teaching materials and provision of sanitation and 
                    hygiene facilities.

                    <p>
                        Early Childhood Development (ECD) is an investment for life. 90 percent of 
                        brain development takes place before a child’s fifth birthday, and children 
                        who participate in ECD get a head start in their emotional and cognitive 
                        development, are more likely to do well in school and become productive 
                        adults. ECD is however not accessible by more than two-third of children 
                        in Uganda and especially those in refugee settlements.

                    <p>
                        We aim to ensure that underprivileged girls and boys aged 2-6 years have 
                        access to holistic and inclusive Early Childhood Development which is a 
                        very important foundation for mental, social, and spiritual development of 
                        a child in the early ages of their life, lack of which can lead to late 
                        start in joining school, retardation in learning and antisocial behaviors. 
                        P4T started providing quality ECD in 2015 for refugees and Ugandan infants. 
                        Each year, we conduct graduation ceremony for children completing Early 
                        Childhood Development (ECD)/pre-school education and prepare them to join 
                        primary education.

                        P4T is providing quality primary education for refugees and Ugandan 
                        infants from age 6 years to 17 years old. P4T Primary school started in 
                        2016 the lower primary classes with only 30 children but today we educate 
                        over 500 children. On the 21st February 2018, P4T Primary School was 
                        licensed with the Ministry of Education and Sport with license number 
                        ME/P/9478. We believe in the power of education to prepare refugees for a 
                        brighter future. “Refugee children, future leaders”, says Bienvenu

                        prepare students to transition effectively into secondary school and have

                        keep them in school. We have school computers that allows the children to 
                        acquire computer skills, access online studies. We also provide on-campus 
                        accommodation to primary six and candidate students and we hope to

                        Malnutrition is real in our community, yet a hungry child cannot concentrate 
                        in class. Our idea is to increase enrollment and retention of refugee children 
                        in schools in Kyangwali refugee settlement by engaging children, teachers and 
                        parents. The project benefits both refugee and host community children who 
                        have struggled in class because of lack of midday school meals both in 
                        ECD/Nursery and primary school children. Early malnutrition can adversely 
                        affect physical, mental, and social aspects of child health, which in turn 
                        leads to underweight, stunted growth, lowered immunity, and mortality.

                        P4T support school to provide hot meals to the children during break and lunch 
                        times. The purpose of this program is to fight hunger in school to reduce 
                        absenteeism, and school dropouts, ulcers, and malnutrition, while improving 
                        enrollment and concentration in class as well as excellence in academic 
                        performance. P4T has provided hot meals for the last 6 years; 320,000+ meal 
                        days to over 1,200 children and 110 school staff.

                        Our children participate in a wide variety of co-curricular activities where 
                        they also compete with other schools in refugee settlements and host community 
                        in Uganda. The activities include Music dance and Drama, Culture club, 
                        debating, netball, football and volleyball and other games and plays. Our 
                        children have performed well from local to national best in athletics, 
                        football, and volleyball . Some of the children have been sponsored in order 
                        to attend other secondary school as the result of their talents.

                    <p>
                        There is only 1 secondary school in Kyangwali and over 80% of refugee children 
                        are not able to afford to pay for their primary, secondary and college school 
                        and 86% of refugee secondary school students are out of school in Uganda. When 
                        they do not join secondary school, their dreams are shattered. The girls get 
                        married off at tender age or are introduced into prostitution by peers while 
                        the boys engage in child labor and most of them get lost in drug and alcohol 
                        abuse at puberty. 40 percent of girls in Uganda are married before the age of 
                        18. Around 10 percent of these girls are married before the age of 15. Around 
                        35% of girls drop out due to marriage and 23% drop out due to pregnancy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In contrast, allowing girls and boys to continue through secondary education 
                        significantly reduces the chances of early marriage and childbearing. Yet 
                        without a secondary education, young people who should be embracing an 
                        important phase of growth, development and opportunity, instead face huge 
                        risks. Denying them a secondary education is like removing an entire section 
                        of a bridge that leads to their futures – the bridge to better financial 
                        prospects, greater independence and great leaders to create positive change in 
                        their own community.

                        P4T plans to start a secondary school to absorb a big number of children who 
                        are not able to join secondary school because of high tuition and lack of 
                        secondary schools in Kyangwali Refugee Settlement. We have already secured 2 
                        acres of land to construct a Secondary school in Kyangwali refugee settlement

                        The program has ensured continued learning and protection for children who
